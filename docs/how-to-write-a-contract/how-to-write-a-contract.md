# How to Write a Contract

sCrypt is an advanced Bitcoin smart contract language that provides base classes, properties, methods, data types, statements, constants, built-in functions, operators, and ScriptContext to achieve a modern programming approach. It is Turing-complete and capable of implementing complex logic. Let's explain the basics of the language through an [example](language).

- [Properties](language#properties)
- [Constructor](language#constructor)
- [Methods](language#methods)
- [Data Types](language#data-types)
- [Statements](language#statements)
- [Compile-time Constant](language#compile-time-constant)
- [Functions](language#functions)
- [Operators](language#operators)
- [ScriptContext](scriptcontext)
- [Built-in functions](built-ins)
- [Stateful Contracts](stateful-contract)
